### Description

This next version of the MSNClient. A few minor bugs were fixed and file transfer is now included. Read the README file included with this zip as it contains some important information about this code. I wanted to wait until I hade voice and video done but I am working on other things right now and this was just laying on my hd. If you like the code, please comment or vote as feedback is always important.
